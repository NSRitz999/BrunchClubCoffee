# the_coffee_and_code

This is the project that was created for our Software Engineering final. This app acts as a visual representation of the amount of coffee consumed over coding hours within a given database. This also includes many side features, such as the ability to watch YouTube videos about coffee making, creating coffee journals, and basic user authentication.
